Some codes that I've written in my life that may be somehow useful to someone else.

## Overview

This repository is a collection of C source codes, written for learning, experimentation, or practical purposes over the years. These programs may serve as references or starting points for your own projects.

## Contents

- Various C source files and projects, each with its own purpose and logic.
- No strict folder structure—explore the repository to find code that interests you.
- Documentation is provided within the source files as comments.

## Installation / Compilation

All code has been compiled and tested using the **Visual Studio 2022 Developer Command Prompt** with `cl.exe` (the Microsoft C/C++ compiler).  
You can compile any `.c` file as follows:

```sh
cl.exe sourcefile.c
```

Or, if you wish to compile and run a program:

```sh
cl.exe example.c
example.exe
```

> **Note:** Some programs may require additional compiler flags or specific input files—check comments in each source file.

## Contributions

This repository is mostly a personal archive, but feel free to fork or use any code you find helpful.  
If you wish to contribute improvements or documentation, open a pull request.

There may be bugs, incomplete features, or outdated programming practices.
